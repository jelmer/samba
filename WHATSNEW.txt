                   =============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.3.6
                           March 8, 2016
                   =============================


This is a security release in order to address the following CVEs:

o  CVE-2015-7560 (Incorrect ACL get/set allowed on symlink path)
o  CVE-2016-0771 (Out-of-bounds read in internal DNS server)

=======
Details
=======

o  CVE-2015-7560:
   All versions of Samba from 3.2.0 to 4.4.0rc3 inclusive are vulnerable to
   a malicious client overwriting the ownership of ACLs using symlinks.

   An authenticated malicious client can use SMB1 UNIX extensions to
   create a symlink to a file or directory, and then use non-UNIX SMB1
   calls to overwrite the contents of the ACL on the file or directory
   linked to.

o  CVE-2016-0771:
   All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 to 4.4.0rc3 inclusive, when deployed as
   an AD DC and choose to run the internal DNS server, are vulnerable to an
   out-of-bounds read issue during DNS TXT record handling caused by users
   with permission to modify DNS records.

   A malicious client can upload a specially constructed DNS TXT record,
   resulting in a remote denial-of-service attack. As long as the affected
   TXT record remains undisturbed in the Samba database, a targeted DNS
   query may continue to trigger this exploit.

   While unlikely, the out-of-bounds read may bypass safety checks and
   allow leakage of memory from the server in the form of a DNS TXT reply.

   By default only authenticated accounts can upload DNS records,
   as "allow dns updates = secure only" is the default.
   Any other value would allow anonymous clients to trigger this
   bug, which is a much higher risk.

                   =============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.3.3
                         December 16, 2015
                   =============================


This is a security release in order to address the following CVEs:

o  CVE-2015-3223 (Denial of service in Samba Active Directory
		  server)
o  CVE-2015-5252 (Insufficient symlink verification in smbd)
o  CVE-2015-5299 (Missing access control check in shadow copy
		  code)
o  CVE-2015-5296 (Samba client requesting encryption vulnerable
		  to downgrade attack)
o  CVE-2015-8467 (Denial of service attack against Windows
		  Active Directory server)
o  CVE-2015-5330 (Remote memory read in Samba LDAP server)

Please note that if building against a system libldb, the required
version has been bumped to ldb-1.1.24.  This is needed to ensure
we build against a system ldb library that contains the fixes
for CVE-2015-5330 and CVE-2015-3223.

=======
Details
=======

o  CVE-2015-3223:
   All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 to 4.3.2 inclusive (resp. all
   ldb versions up to 1.1.23 inclusive) are vulnerable to
   a denial of service attack in the samba daemon LDAP server.

   A malicious client can send packets that cause the LDAP server in the
   samba daemon process to become unresponsive, preventing the server
   from servicing any other requests.

   This flaw is not exploitable beyond causing the code to loop expending
   CPU resources.

o  CVE-2015-5252:
   All versions of Samba from 3.0.0 to 4.3.2 inclusive are vulnerable to
   a bug in symlink verification, which under certain circumstances could
   allow client access to files outside the exported share path.

   If a Samba share is configured with a path that shares a common path
   prefix with another directory on the file system, the smbd daemon may
   allow the client to follow a symlink pointing to a file or directory
   in that other directory, even if the share parameter "wide links" is
   set to "no" (the default).

o  CVE-2015-5299:
   All versions of Samba from 3.2.0 to 4.3.2 inclusive are vulnerable to
   a missing access control check in the vfs_shadow_copy2 module. When
   looking for the shadow copy directory under the share path the current
   accessing user should have DIRECTORY_LIST access rights in order to
   view the current snapshots.

   This was not being checked in the affected versions of Samba.

o  CVE-2015-5296:
   Versions of Samba from 3.2.0 to 4.3.2 inclusive do not ensure that
   signing is negotiated when creating an encrypted client connection to
   a server.

   Without this a man-in-the-middle attack could downgrade the connection
   and connect using the supplied credentials as an unsigned, unencrypted
   connection.

o  CVE-2015-8467:
   Samba, operating as an AD DC, is sometimes operated in a domain with a
   mix of Samba and Windows Active Directory Domain Controllers.

   All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 to 4.3.2 inclusive, when deployed as
   an AD DC in the same domain with Windows DCs, could be used to
   override the protection against the MS15-096 / CVE-2015-2535 security
   issue in Windows.

   Prior to MS16-096 it was possible to bypass the quota of machine
   accounts a non-administrative user could create.  Pure Samba domains
   are not impacted, as Samba does not implement the
   SeMachineAccountPrivilege functionality to allow non-administrator
   users to create new computer objects.

o  CVE-2015-5330:
   All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 to 4.3.2 inclusive (resp. all
   ldb versions up to 1.1.23 inclusive) are vulnerable to
   a remote memory read attack in the samba daemon LDAP server.

   A malicious client can send packets that cause the LDAP server in the
   samba daemon process to return heap memory beyond the length of the
   requested value.

   This memory may contain data that the client should not be allowed to
   see, allowing compromise of the server.

   The memory may either be returned to the client in an error string, or
   stored in the database by a suitabily privileged user.  If untrusted
   users can create objects in your database, please confirm that all DN
   and name attributes are reasonable.


Changes since 4.3.2:
--------------------

o  Andrew Bartlett <abartlet@samba.org>
   * BUG 11552: CVE-2015-8467: samdb: Match MS15-096 behaviour for
     userAccountControl.

o  Jeremy Allison <jra@samba.org>
   * BUG 11325: CVE-2015-3223: Fix LDAP \00 search expression attack DoS.
   * BUG 11395: CVE-2015-5252: Fix insufficient symlink verification (file
     access outside the share).
   * BUG 11529: CVE-2015-5299: s3-shadow-copy2: Fix missing access check on
     snapdir.

o  Douglas Bagnall <douglas.bagnall@catalyst.net.nz>
   * BUG 11599: CVE-2015-5330: Fix remote read memory exploit in LDB.

o  Stefan Metzmacher <metze@samba.org>
   * BUG 11536: CVE-2015-5296: Add man in the middle protection when forcing
     smb encryption on the client side.

                   =============================
                   Release Notes for Samba 4.3.0
                           September 8, 2015
                   =============================


This is the first stable release of Samba 4.3.


UPGRADING
=========

Read the "New FileChangeNotify subsystem" and "smb.conf changes" sections
(below).


NEW FEATURES
============

Logging
-------

The logging code now supports logging to multiple backends.  In
addition to the previously available syslog and file backends, the
backends for logging to the systemd-journal, lttng and gpfs have been
added. Please consult the section for the 'logging' parameter in the
smb.conf manpage for details.

Spotlight
---------

Support for Apple's Spotlight has been added by integrating with Gnome
Tracker.

For detailed instructions how to build and setup Samba for Spotlight,
please see the Samba wiki: <https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Spotlight>

New FileChangeNotify subsystem
------------------------------

Samba now contains a new subsystem to do FileChangeNotify. The
previous system used a central database, notify_index.tdb, to store
all notification requests. In particular in a cluster this turned out
to be a major bottleneck, because some hot records need to be bounced
back and forth between nodes on every change event like a new created
file.

The new FileChangeNotify subsystem works with a central daemon per
node. Every FileChangeNotify request and every event are handled by an
asynchronous message from smbd to the notify daemon. The notify daemon
maintains a database of all FileChangeNotify requests in memory and
will distribute the notify events accordingly. This database is
asynchronously distributed in the cluster by the notify daemons.

The notify daemon is supposed to scale a lot better than the previous
implementation. The functional advantage is cross-node kernel change
notify: Files created via NFS will be seen by SMB clients on other
nodes per FileChangeNotify, despite the fact that popular cluster file
systems do not offer cross-node inotify.

Two changes to the configuration were required for this new subsystem:
The parameters "change notify" and "kernel change notify" are not
per-share anymore but must be set globally. So it is no longer
possible to enable or disable notify per share, the notify daemon has
no notion of a share, it only works on absolute paths.

New SMB profiling code
----------------------

The code for SMB (SMB1, SMB2 and SMB3) profiling uses a tdb instead
of sysv IPC shared memory. This avoids performance problems and NUMA
effects. The profile stats are a bit more detailed than before.

Improved DCERPC man in the middle detection for kerberos
--------------------------------------------------------

The gssapi based kerberos backends for gensec have support for
DCERPC header signing when using DCERPC_AUTH_LEVEL_PRIVACY.

SMB signing required in winbindd by default
-------------------------------------------

The effective value for "client signing" is required
by default for winbindd, if the primary domain uses active directory.

Experimental NTDB was removed
-----------------------------

The experimental NTDB library introduced in Samba 4.0 has been
removed again.

Improved support for trusted domains (as AD DC)
-----------------------------------------------

The support for trusted domains/forests has improved a lot.

samba-tool got "domain trust" subcommands to manage trusts:

  create      - Create a domain or forest trust.
  delete      - Delete a domain trust.
  list        - List domain trusts.
  namespaces  - Manage forest trust namespaces.
  show        - Show trusted domain details.
  validate    - Validate a domain trust.

External trusts between individual domains work in both ways
(inbound and outbound). The same applies to root domains of
a forest trust. The transitive routing into the other forest
is fully functional for kerberos, but not yet supported for NTLMSSP.

While a lot of things are working fine, there are currently a few limitations:

  - Both sides of the trust need to fully trust each other!
  - No SID filtering rules are applied at all!
  - This means DCs of domain A can grant domain admin rights
    in domain B.
  - It's not possible to add users/groups of a trusted domain
    into domain groups.

SMB 3.1.1 supported
-------------------

Both client and server have support for SMB 3.1.1 now.

This is the dialect introduced with Windows 10, it improves the secure
negotiation of SMB dialects and features.

There's also a new optinal encryption algorithm aes-gcm-128,
but for now this is only selected as fallback and aes-ccm-128
is preferred because of the better performance. This might change
in future versions when hardware encryption will be supported.
See https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11451.

New smbclient subcommands
-------------------------

  - Query a directory for change notifications: notify <dir name>
  - Server side copy: scopy <source filename> <destination filename>

New rpcclient subcommands
-------------------------

  netshareenumall 	- Enumerate all shares
  netsharegetinfo 	- Get Share Info
  netsharesetinfo 	- Set Share Info
  netsharesetdfsflags	- Set DFS flags
  netfileenum		- Enumerate open files
  netnamevalidate	- Validate sharename
  netfilegetsec		- Get File security
  netsessdel		- Delete Session
  netsessenum		- Enumerate Sessions
  netdiskenum		- Enumerate Disks
  netconnenum		- Enumerate Connections
  netshareadd		- Add share
  netsharedel		- Delete share

New modules
-----------

  idmap_script 		- see 'man 8 idmap_script'
  vfs_unityed_media	- see 'man 8 vfs_unityed_media'
  vfs_shell_snap	- see 'man 8 vfs_shell_snap'

New sparsely connected replia graph (Improved KCC)
--------------------------------------------------

The Knowledge Consistency Checker (KCC) maintains a replication graph
for DCs across an AD network. The existing Samba KCC uses a fully
connected graph, so that each DC replicates from all the others, which
does not scale well with large networks. In 4.3 there is an
experimental new KCC that creates a sparsely connected replication
graph and closely follows Microsoft's specification. It is turned off
by default. To use the new KCC, set "kccsrv:samba_kcc=true" in
smb.conf and let us know how it goes. You should consider doing this
if you are making a large new network. For small networks there is
little benefit and you can always switch over at a later date.

Configurable TLS protocol support, with better defaults
-------------------------------------------------------

The "tls priority" option can be used to change the supported TLS
protocols. The default is to disable SSLv3, which is no longer
considered secure.

Samba-tool now supports all 7 FSMO roles
-------------------------------------------------------

Previously "samba-tool fsmo" could only show, transfer or seize the
five well-known FSMO roles:

	Schema Master
	Domain Naming Master
	RID Master
	PDC Emulator
	Infrastructure Master

It can now also show, transfer or seize the DNS infrastructure roles:

	DomainDnsZones Infrastructure Master
	ForestDnsZones Infrastructure Master

CTDB logging changes
--------------------

The destination for CTDB logging is now set via a single new
configuration variable CTDB_LOGGING.  This replaces CTDB_LOGFILE and
CTDB_SYSLOG, which have both been removed.  See ctdbd.conf(5) for
details of CTDB_LOGGING.

CTDB no longer runs a separate logging daemon.

CTDB NFS support changes
------------------------

CTDB's NFS service management has been combined into a single 60.nfs
event script.  This updated 60.nfs script now uses a call-out to
interact with different NFS implementations.  See the CTDB_NFS_CALLOUT
option in the ctdbd.conf(5) manual page for details.  A default
call-out is provided to interact with the Linux kernel NFS
implementation.  The 60.ganesha event script has been removed - a
sample call-out is provided for NFS Ganesha, based on this script.

The method of configuring NFS RPC checks has been improved.  See
ctdb/config/nfs-checks.d/README for details.

Improved Cross-Compiling Support
--------------------------------

A new "hybrid" build configuration mode is added to improve
cross-compilation support.

A common challenge in cross-compilation is that of obtaining the results
of tests that have to run on the target, during the configuration
phase of the build. The Samba build system already supports the following
means to do so:

  - Executing configure tests using the --cross-execute parameter
  - Obtaining the results from an answers file using the --cross-answers
    parameter

The first method has the drawback of inaccurate results if the tests are
run using an emulator, or a need to be connected to a running target
while building, if the tests are to be run on an actual target. The
second method presents a challenge of figuring out the test results.

The new hybrid mode runs the tests and records the result in an answer file.
To activate this mode, use both --cross-execute and --cross-answers in the
same configure invocation. This mode can be activated once against a
running target, and then the generated answers file can be used in
subsequent builds.

Also supplied is an example script that can be used as the
cross-execute program. This script copies the test to a running target
and runs the test on the target, obtaining the result. The obtained
results are more accurate than running the test with an emulator, because
they reflect the exact kernel and system libraries that exist on the
target.

Improved Sparse File Support
----------------------------
Support for the FSCTL_SET_ZERO_DATA and FSCTL_QUERY_ALLOCATED_RANGES
SMB2 requests has been added to the smbd file server.
This allows for clients to deallocate (hole punch) regions within a
sparse file, and check which portions of a file are allocated.
